# iACM Website WoC Project

### Main URLs
- `/` - home page
- `/register` - registration page
- `/login` - log in page
- `/sidebar` - sidebar template page
- `/SIGpage/<str:SIGname>` - SIG specific page

### Notes
- Website opens with home page currently. Would Ideally have first page be log-in page (with link to registration if no account)
- Registration Page currently registers a new account / user however login has not been implemented.
- Home page has a list of boxes which would ideally be the mini image and title with description of each of the projects. 
- The drop down menu within the sidebar has each SIGs projects as well. however currently you can only go to them from the homepage and not from another SIG specific page.
